# FootSnap
FootSnap.
An Android application I created for my final year university project.
Purpose of application is to take pictures of diabetic feet.
To track the progress of diabetic foot ulcers.

Firstly a user takes a photo of one of their feet. Using the New Photo page.
This image is saved to the phone using the Users details.
Over time more images will be taken of the users foot.
When a user goes to take a new photo a ghost image is placed over the camera.
The ghost image is created using the first image taken by the user.
A canny edge detection algorithm is ran the..........


Main Features
- Login page
- Menu page -> used for naviagtion around application
- Take new photo page -> used to take a users first foot image. This image is the starting point for the comparison 
- Take another photo page
